# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a C# Windows Forms Application that recreates the classic Minesweeper game but with a new UI.

## Getting started
To run Minesweeper on your computer, simply download the latest zip file from the [releases section](https://github.com/ManuelKlaer/windows-forms-minesweeper/releases) of the GitHub repository, extract it, and run the "Minsweeper.exe" executable.

*Note: When running the executable, you may see a Windows Defender popup that warns you that the application is from an unknown author. This is normal and expected, and you can safely run the application as long as you downloaded it from the original source (GitHub). To run the application, simply click on "More info" and then "Run anyway". If you have any concerns about the safety of the application, please do not hesitate to contact the developers.*
