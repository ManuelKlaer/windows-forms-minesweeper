# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a C# Windows Forms Application that recreates the classic Minesweeper game but with a new UI.

## Getting started
To run Minesweeper on your computer, simply download the latest zip file from the [releases section](https://github.com/ManuelKlaer/windows-forms-minesweeper/releases) of the GitHub repository, extract it, and run the "Minsweeper.exe" executable.

*Note: You need to have the latest .NET Desktop Runtime 7 installed on your computer.*

*Note: When running the executable, you may see a Windows Defender popup that warns you that the application is from an unknown author. This is normal and expected, and you can safely run the application as long as you downloaded it from the [original source](https://github.com/ManuelKlaer/windows-forms-minesweeper/releases). To run the application, simply click on "More info" and then "Run anyway". If you have any concerns about the safety of the application, please do not hesitate to contact the developers.*

## Requirements
To run Minesweeper, you need to have .NET Desktop Runtime 7 installed on your computer. If you don't have it installed, you can download it from [Microsoft's website](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0).

### Installing the .NET Desktop Runtime 7 using winget
Alternatively, if you have the winget package manager installed on your computer, you can install the .NET Desktop Runtime by running the following command in a command prompt or PowerShell window:
