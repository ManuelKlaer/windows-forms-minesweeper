## Portable Installation
The portable installation allows you to use Minesweeper as an application that can be carried and run on different systems without the need for installation. Simply download the portable version and run it on your desired system.

Requirements: The target system must have `.NET Desktop Runtime 7` installed. If it's not already installed, you will need to install it before running the portable version of Minesweeper.

## Installer Installation
The installer installation provides a convenient way to install Minesweeper as a desktop application directly on your PC.

Requirements: Please note that the installer does not come with an official certificate. Therefore, you need to install the certificate first before continuing with the installation.

## Windows Defender
Note: When executing any executable file, you may encounter a Windows Defender prompt indicating that the application is from an unknown author. This is a normal and expected behavior. You can safely run the application if you have downloaded it from the [original source](https://github.com/ManuelKlaer/windows-forms-minesweeper). To proceed with running the application, simply click on "More info" and then "Run anyway." If you have any concerns regarding the safety of this application, please feel free to contact the developers.
